This repository contains the codes that was used to produce the experimental evaluation in the following paper:

> Olaosebikan, S. and Manlove, D. (2020). Super-stability in the student-project allocation problem with ties. 
Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, (doi: 10.1007/s10878-020-00632-x) (Early Online Publication)

=========

> instanceGenerator.py

This writes to a .txt file, a randomly-generated instance of the Student-Project Allocation problem with students preferences over projects, lecturer preferences over Students, and with Ties (SPA-ST).

=========

> readinput.py

This reads the instance from the .txt file into a suitable data structure representing the students, projects and lecturers preference information.

=========

> bruteforce.py

This finds all the super-stable matching, given an instance of SPA-ST, should one exist. The purpose of implementing this approach was mainly for correctness testing of our implementation of the polynomial-time algorithm (spastsuper.py). The bruteforce implementation terminates in less than 5 seconds, on SPA-ST instances consisting of no more than 10 students with a preference list length of 3.
